# Sci-Map.org api

Backend (GraphQl API) for [Sci-map.org](https://sci-map.org).

### Tech stack and design

Node.js + Typescript, Neo4j, Apollo Server.
We are considering a switch towards neo4j-graphql-js as it would highly improve the queries performance, however it currently lacks some features.
